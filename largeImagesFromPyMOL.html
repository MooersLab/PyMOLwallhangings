<h1>Blow up image from PyMOL for a wall hanging</h1>


<p><b>Goal:</b> Remake a published figure with square dimensions (28in by 28in) at 225 dpi. This leads to an image that is 5 to 15 MB is the size after conversion to tiff. Annotations should be added manually to this tiff file.</p>

<h3>Protocol:</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>set hash_max, 2000</code> in pymolrc.</li>
<li><code>set ray_shadows, off</code>.</li>
<li>Load the structure via pdb or pse file or a pml file.</li>
<li>Set the X and Y in inches in the Draw/Ray.</li>
<li>Set the units to inches.</li>
<li>Set the DPI to 225.</li>
<li>Turn off transparent background.</li>
<li>Ray trace.</li>
<li>Save png file. </li>
<li>Save as pse file (use the spse shortcut) and save pml file used to make the image.</li>
<li>Skip ahead to use <b>png2tiff</b> if you have no annotations to add. 
<hr>
<li>Load image file into inkscape as a png file and using the dimensions of the image.</li>
<li>Change the dimensions of the document to those of the image.</li>
<li>Set the font to Helvetica, 72 point. </li>
<li>Use control-D to duplicate the first label to use as a template to make additional labels.</li>
<li>Add the arrows with a weight of 4. Draw a horizonal arrow first and then duplicate it.</li>
<li>Save as a svg file so that the anotatations can be recycled at a later time. </li>
<li>Export as png file using the export function in the right panel. Be sure that the orignal dimensions are used to save the image.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Convert to tiff file with the unix <b>convert</b> program that comes with imagemagik, which is available from homebrew or MacPorts on the Mac, CygWin on Windows, and various software managers on Linux. </li>
<li>To convert several to many png files to tiff files, use the bash script below. The script will convert all pngs in a folder to tiff files. All you enter is <b>png2tiff</b>.</li>
<li>If you put this code into <b>png2tiff.sh</b>, store it in your <b>~/Scripts</b> folder, and then add <b>source ~/Scripts/png2tiff.sh</b> to your .bashrc or .zshrc file, this function will be available anywhere in your home account by entering <b>png2tiff</b>. You will never have to search for the script. I actually store the command <b>source ~/Scripts/png2tiff.sh</b> in <b>.bashFunctionSources</b>. I then source this file from my  <b>.zshenv</b> file, which is where I keep all of my PATHs, sources, and exports. This file is in turn sourced by my .zshrc file. I can enter <b>more ~/.bashFunctionSources</b> from anywhere to see a list of the scripts that are available. I have also mapped this command to the alias like <b>alias bf='more ~/.bashFunctionSources'</b> so that I can invoke the list of bash functions form anyhwere in my home directory.</li>
</ol>


<div class="highlight"><pre><code>
png2tiff()
{
echo "Convert all of the png files in a directory to tiffs."
echo "Usage: png2tiff"
echo "There are no arguments."
echo "Explanation"
echo "Uses the convert program that comes with ImageMagick."
echo "The latter is a Unix program that can be installed with homebrew or MacPorts."
echo "Note that the bash command basename takes .png as a second argument,"
echo "so this function can be adapted to other input filename extensions including ones with several delimiters."
if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Convert all png files in a directory to tiffs."
  echo 1>&2 "$0: too many arguments"
  echo "Usage: png2tiff"
  return 2
fi
for FILE in ./*.png;
  do;
  echo "${FILE}";
  bbb=$(basename ${FILE} .png);
  echo "$bbb";
  convert "${bbb}".png "${bbb}".tiff;
  echo "Successfully converted png to tiff.";
  done;
ls -ltr ./*.tiff;
echo "All done. Spared of more tedium once again by bash."
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>

This is much better than having to specify each png file one at a time.
